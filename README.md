# POCSI (POint Charge SImulation of electric field gradient)

## Author: Jonathan Frassineti

This is the code I wrote in Python3 that allows the user to calculate the electric field gradient (or EFG) from a point charge distribution in a crystal, in the desired position. Also, there is the possibility to add an impurity (vacancy, particle, ...) and calculate the EFG with this perturbation.

The main file is [pocsi](https://github.com/JonathanFrassineti/POCSI/blob/main/Code/pocsi.py), while an example of the usage can be found in [pocsi_example](https://github.com/JonathanFrassineti/POCSI/blob/main/Code/pocsi_example.py).
Please, read the [pocsi_example](https://github.com/JonathanFrassineti/POCSI/blob/main/Code/pocsi_example.py) file carefully, to understand how the software works.

For physical details about what is the EFG, and what is the point charge approximation, please visit:
