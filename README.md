This is the code I wrote in Python3 that allows the user to calculate the electric field gradient (or EFG) from a point charge distribution in a crystal,
in the desired postition.

The main file is [EFG_point_charge](https://github.com/JonathanFrassineti/Point-Charge-Electric-Field-Gradient/blob/master/EFG_point_charge.py), while [EFG_functions](https://github.com/JonathanFrassineti/Point-Charge-Electric-Field-Gradient/blob/master/EFG_functions.py) contains all the functions used to calculate the EFG and [Crystalline_structure](https://github.com/JonathanFrassineti/Point-Charge-Electric-Field-Gradient/blob/master/Crystalline_structure.py) the definition of the atomic bases of the material.

For physical details about what is the EFG, and what is the point charge approximation, please visit:
